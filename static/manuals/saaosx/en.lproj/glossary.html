<h1>Using the Glossary</h1>

<p>The built in glossary provides support for looking up translations for the Akkadian terms used in the accompanying texts, as well as searching for all instances of a given term. Unlike the Oracc interface, it does not yet offer the ability to perform more refined lookups, such as by written or normalised forms.</p>
