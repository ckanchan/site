<h1>First Steps</h1>

<p>SAAo-SX is a macOS app designed to provide a fast, offline-first interface to the State Archives of Assyria projects and other cuneiform texts. It has three main interfaces:</p>

<h4 id="catalogue">Catalogue</h4>

<p>The catalogue window simply displays a list of text in its left pane, and metadata about that selected text in the right. You can select a text for reading from this window, bookmark it or open its <a href="topic-asides-oracc.html#topic-asides-oracc" aside="topic-asides-oracc" class="xRef Aside">Oracc edition</a> in your default browser. SAAo-SX comes with a builtin offline database incorporating many of the texts included in the State Archives of Assyria project. Alternatively, SAAo-SX can also download catalogues and their accompanying texts from the internet. <a href="#/topic-en.lproj-catalogues" title="Navigating Catalogues">Read more</a></p>

<h4 id="text-viewer">Text Viewer</h4>

<p>The text viewer displays cuneiform texts. It is designed to make it easy to view a text in any of its possible representations: as a transliteration, normalisation, translation, or 'cuneified' approximation. It loads texts selected from the Catalogue window, but can also read texts opened directly. <a href="#/topic-en.lproj-texts" title="Reading Texts">Read more</a></p>

<h4 id="glossary">Glossary</h4>

<p>Browse the computer-generated SAAo glossary, and look up all texts which contain a given lemma. <a href="/Resources/SharedGlobalAssets/images/glossary.png">Read more</a></p>
