<p>The Open Richly Annotated Cuneiform Corpus ('Oracc') is an international scholarly effort to compile and make freely available accurate and interactive editions of cuneiform texts. It serves as a repository for many Akkadian and Sumerian texts, as well as glossaries and informational sites. Tup≈°enna is built on the data formats defined by the Oracc project; the texts in the builtin database, as well as the included glossary, are generated from open data provided by the SAAo project and used under licence.
