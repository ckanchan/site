      <td><strong>1</strong> Text Volumes</td>
      <td>Lists all volumes available for reading. Tap on a volume entry to download it for reading offline. A checkmark next to the volume indicates it is available for reading. Tapping on a volume that has a checkmark next to it will prompt if you want to remove it from your device.</td>

      <td><strong>2</strong> Storage</td>
      <td>Shows how much storage downloaded volumes are occupying on your device. If you need to free up some storage, tap on individual downloaded volumes in (1) to delete them. Alternatively, tap 'Delete all downloads' to clear the local database. You will need to download at least one volume again before you can make use of the app fully again.</td>
