<h1>Inserting and editing lemmas</h1>

<p>The <em>lemma</em> is a basic unit of meaning in a cuneiform script, roughly corresponding to a 'word' in modern languages. A sentence is made up of multiple lemmas; multiple sentences make up a whole document. A lemma can consist of multiple cuneiform signs, including a base morpheme, verb inflexions, prefixes, and suffixes, depending on the language the user is writing in.
In Tupshar, a lemma comprises three user-defined elements:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Normalisation</strong>: a rendering of the whole lemma into Roman script. A variety of different normalisation conventions exist for the different languages written in cuneiform - the choice of which conventions to use rests with the user.</li>
  <li><strong>Transliteration</strong>: represents each individual cuneiform sign that makes up the lemma. Unlike a normalisation, the transliterated values of signs follow values defined in 'standard' sign lists, the <a href="topic-asides-mzl.html#topic-asides-mzl" aside="topic-asides-mzl" class="xRef Aside">MZL</a> and <a href="topic-asides-labat.html#topic-asides-labat" aside="topic-asides-labat" class="xRef Aside">Labat</a> sign lists. Tupshar uses these values to generate a cuneiform representation of the text automatically.</li>
  <li><strong>Translation</strong>: a translation of the lemma, which should include the base noun, verb or other morpheme, as well as pronominal prefixes, suffixes, inflections, copulae, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <em>Edit pane</em> requires you to input these three values before adding a lemma to the text. If one of the fields is missing, then no change is made to the document. If all of the fields are left empty, then a line break is added to the document.</p>

<p>Oftentimes you will need to use special transliteration characters (e.g. š, ṭ, á, à etc.), which you can input either by typing them in directly, or using character combinations that can be typed with a standard QWERTY keyboard, which Tupshar will automatically convert to special characters when adding the lemma. These combinations are listed <a href="#/topic-en.lproj-tupsharATF">here</a>.
The edit pane also allows you to edit a lemma that has already been inserted into the document, by selecting the desired lemma in the Text View pane.</p>
