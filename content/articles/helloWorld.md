This is a traditional 'Hello world!' post to check out whether everything's working on this site, which is not only my personal page but also a work-in-progress learning project for web dev.
This initial release is made with the [Hugo static site generator](https://gohugo.io/), as a straightforward static site serves my needs (articles and a portfolio) well. I'm developing the theme in concert with the site as part of webdev learning, and as such it's a pretty simple patchwork at the moment.
The site is developed in the open on [Github](https://github.com/ckanchan/site) for the curious.
