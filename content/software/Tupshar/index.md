## *Tupshar* 'The Scribe' (Akkadian language)

Tupshar is a document editing app designed to make it easier to compose and edit texts in the cuneiform script on your Mac. Based off open formats for encoding computer cuneiform, Tupshar lets you produce richly annotated documents, with each word encoding its own cuneiform, transliteration, normalisation and translation representations.
